I want a 2d window that simulates a bouncy ball bouncing. 
It will have gravity

A ball has x, y, radius, direction, and speed.
Velocity is both direction and speed

Direction = 
If the ball hits a wall, you get money
IF the ball hits a wall it 
You can drag and throw the ball 

You can buy upgrades to reduce gravity, increase speed, buy more balls, buy new bouncing shapes, customize the border and back, change the shape of the borders
If ball is not at a high enough speed, there is no money made
